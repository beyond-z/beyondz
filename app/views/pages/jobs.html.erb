		<h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
		<p>Location: San Francisco or Chicago</p>
		<strong>Job Description</strong>
			<p>As our first tech hire, you will be responsible for planning, implementing, maintaining, and innovating Beyond Z’s web platform, a one stop shop where low-income students can get access to opportunities online that their high-income peers have access to offline. The social network technology platform will integrate already-existing technologies all in one place, and give participants opportunities to connect with their peers and adult role models (e.g. through Quora-like question and answers, TED talks, real-time chat and video-conferencing); view educational content (e.g. Khan Academy, Rosetta Stone, lessons on personal finance/investing); participate in online activities (e.g. online debates, chess tournaments, programming classes); and track their progress though a points system and badges. Later, the site will become a platform where developers will be able to build apps specifically tailored to help low-income students.</p>
			<p>Specific responsibilities will include:<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developing a vision and plan for Beyond Z’s platform, ensuring that we use cutting-edge and innovative technology</li>
				<li>Participating in all stages of the product lifecycle – thinking up new features, programming them, and rapidly iterating</li>
				<li>Designing ways to use technology to track the progress and achievements of Beyond Z participants; use analytics to optimize and improve on the platform</li>
				<li>Working closely with the program team to ensure that the product and the platform are working together effectively</li>
			</ul>

			<strong>Skills and Requirements</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Experience building across the full stack (we are platform agnostic, though prefer someone who programs in Django or Ruby on Rails), and the ability to execute quickly and iterate rapidly</li>
				<li>Program management experience, and the ability to understand the big picture of the technology to be developed</li>
				<li>A desire to work as part of a small, fast-paced, and highly-flexible team</li>
				<li>A passion for education, and a belief that all young people, regardless of income background or race, have access to the opportunities that ensure educational and life success</li>
			</ul>

			<strong>About Beyond Z</strong>
			<p>Beyond Z is a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that low-income students are set up to reach positions of impact and leadership by giving them access to world-class opportunities, networks, and technologies.</p>

			<p>Beyond Z takes a three-pronged approach. First, we provide our participants with incredible opportunities and experiences – for example, learning how to code, participating in speech and debate, playing chess, and travelling abroad. Second, we place our participants in small cohorts and provide them with adult champions who help participants master important skills, gain access to transformative learning experiences, build extensive social and professional networks. Third, we provide students with our technology platform, which connects the Beyond Z community in a social network while providing access to knowledge and social capital.</p>
