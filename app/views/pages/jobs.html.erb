			<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>

				<p>Location: San Francisco or Chicago</p>
				<strong>Job Description</strong>
				<p>As our first tech hire, you will be responsible for planning, implementing, maintaining, and innovating Beyond Z’s web platform, a one stop shop where low-income students can get access to opportunities online that their high-income peers have access to offline. The social network technology platform will integrate already-existing technologies all in one place, and give participants opportunities to connect with their peers and adult role models (e.g. through Quora-like question and answers, TED talks, real-time chat and video-conferencing); view educational content (e.g. Khan Academy, Rosetta Stone, lessons on personal finance/investing); participate in online activities (e.g. online debates, chess tournaments, programming classes); and track their progress though a points system and badges. Later, the site will become a platform where developers will be able to build apps specifically tailored to help low-income students.</p>
				<p>Specific responsibilities will include:<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Developing a vision and plan for Beyond Z’s platform, ensuring that we use cutting-edge and innovative technology</li>
					<li>Participating in all stages of the product lifecycle – thinking up new features, programming them, and rapidly iterating</li>
					<li>Designing ways to use technology to track the progress and achievements of Beyond Z participants; use analytics to optimize and improve on the platform</li>
					<li>Working closely with the program team to ensure that the product and the platform are working together effectively</li>
				</ul>

				<strong>Skills and Requirements</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Experience building across the full stack (we are platform agnostic, though prefer someone who programs in Django or Ruby on Rails), and the ability to execute quickly and iterate rapidly</li>
					<li>Program management experience, and the ability to understand the big picture of the technology to be developed</li>
					<li>A desire to work as part of a small, fast-paced, and highly-flexible team</li>
					<li>A passion for education, and a belief that all young people, regardless of income background or race, have access to the opportunities that ensure educational and life success</li>
				</ul>

				<strong>About Beyond Z</strong>
